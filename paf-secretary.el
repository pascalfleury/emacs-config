;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This module implements helper functions for team management.  It
;; makes it easy to keep track of the work of several people.  It
;; keeps context (with whom and where you are) and allows you to use
;; it to metadata to your notes, and to query the tasks associated
;; with the people you are with and the place.
;;
;; See http://juanreyero.com/article/emacs/org-teams.html for a full
;; explanation and configuration instructions.
;;
;;; Configuration
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;
;; In short; your todos use the TODO keyword, your team's use TASK.
;; Your org-todo-keywords should look something like this:
;;
;; (setq org-todo-keywords
;;       '((sequence "TODO(t)" "|" "DONE(d)" "CANCELLED(c)")
;;         (sequence "TASK(f)" "|" "DONE(d)")
;;         (sequence "MAYBE(m)" "|" "CANCELLED(c)")))
;;
;; It helps to distinguish them by color, like this:
;;
;; (setq org-todo-keyword-faces
;;       '(("TODO" . (:foreground "DarkOrange1" :weight bold))
;;         ("MAYBE" . (:foreground "sea green"))
;;         ("DONE" . (:foreground "light sea green"))
;;         ("CANCELLED" . (:foreground "forest green"))
;;         ("TASK" . (:foreground "blue"))))
;;
;; If you want to keep track of stuck projects you should tag your
;; projects with :prj:, and define:
;;
;; (setq org-tags-exclude-from-inheritance '("prj")
;;       org-stuck-projects '("+prj/-MAYBE-DONE"
;;                            ("TODO" "TASK") ()))
;;
;; Define a tag that marks TASK entries as yours:
;;
;; (setq paf-sec-me "paf")
;;
;; Finally, you add the special views to your org-agenda-custom-commands:
;;
;; (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
;;       '(("h" "Work todos" tags-todo
;;          "-personal-doat={.+}-dowith={.+}/!-TASK"
;;          ((org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled t)))
;;         ("H" "All work todos" tags-todo "-personal/!-TASK-MAYBE"
;;          ((org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled nil)))
;;         ("A" "Work todos with doat or dowith" tags-todo
;;          "-personal+doat={.+}|dowith={.+}/!-TASK"
;;          ((org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled nil)))
;;         ("j" "TODO dowith and TASK with"
;;          ((paf-sec-with-view "TODO dowith")
;;           (paf-sec-where-view "TODO doat")
;;           (paf-sec-assigned-with-view "TASK with")
;;           (paf-sec-stuck-with-view "STUCK with")))
;;         ("J" "Interactive TODO dowith and TASK with"
;;          ((paf-sec-who-view "TODO dowith")))))
;;
;;; Usage
;;;;;;;;;
;;
;;  Do C-c w to say with whom you are meeting (a space-separated list
;;  of names). Maybe do also C-c W to say where you are.  Then do C-c a
;;  j to see:
;;     - Todo items defined with TODO (ie, mine) in which the
;;       =with= property matches any of the people with me.
;;     - Todo items defined with TODO in which the =doat= property
;;       matches my current location.
;;     - Todo items defined with TASK that are tagged with the name
;;       of any of the people with me (this is, assigned to them).
;;     - Stuck projects tagged with the name of the people with me.
;;
;; Use C-c j to add meta-data with the people with me, the
;; location and the time to entries.
